###A sleek, aesthetic terminal.
I'm applying for the CODE2040 fellowship this year, and decided to build a terminal emulator from scratch as a platform for the API challenge.

####Features include:
- Easy scripthook integration
- Tab auto-completion and echo commands
- History, searchable with arrow keys
- A tiny, multi-color text rendering engine
- Evaluate console commands with a ~ prefix
- Riddles and secrets for nerds
